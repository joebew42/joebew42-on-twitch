What could I say? For everyone that does not know anything about me, I introduce myself as an [*Agile Software Developer*](http://joebew42.github.io/about/). You can read more about me by following that link.

During the last year I was quite fascinated by [Twitch](https://twitch.tv), a community in which people can setup their own streaming channel and starts to share experiences with the world. I enjoyed the engagement with the viewers. People can interact with the broadcaster by typing directly in the chat box. It is fantastic and it is real time.

At the end, after I made some testing stream sessions and a bit of practice, I decided to start [my own educational channel](https://twitch.tv/joebew42) with the idea to create a community where software developers can join in order to practice, learn and grow around topics like Clean Code, Test-Driven Development and Refactoring. All of these topics will be covered by trying to make contribution to open source projects, or sharing exercise sessions by learning new programming languages or technologies.

The channel will be an **experiment**. If you want to know more about how the channel works, read about the official schedule, or how the monthly donation goals works, and other stuff, I invite you to read the channel panels. I would like to share my journey with you and make the channel grow only if you - *viewers* - wants.

So, this space is born with the idea that I will share insights and experiences of my journey. I am proudly to share with you what I think is a useful resource that each broadcaster should consider to make its channel better. It is a guide, that is called [A Guide to Streaming and Finding Success](http://www.overboredgaming.com/guide.html). I have read it, and I liked it so much. It is full of precious tips!

The next journal update will be released on **September 4th**, when I will officialy start the channel.
