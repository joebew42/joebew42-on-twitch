title: New banners and a more meaningful donation goal
subtitle: For the first time I didn't worry about having new followers

For the first time I didn't worry about having new followers, and it was amazing, why? Because when I started my channel I thought that the most important thing was to increase the number of followers as much as possibile. Completely wrong, for at least three reasons:

* To think about that number keeps your mind busy on that and can be the good source of _frustration_.
* When you do streaming you have only one mission: _to be focused on what you are doing, by trying to do the best as you can_.
* If people thinks that your streaming is something valuable for them, then they will put a follow on you.

So, I continued my journey on [_learning Elixir_](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir-playground). The session was quite good, I am trying to do the best as I can with my english. I find myself more comfortable with the tools and with Twitch. I am happy to see returning viewers, maybe one day I'll invite one of you to do a _pair programming_ session with me :)

### A new set of Twitch banners

I am not used to deal with graphics, so after googled a bit I found this service [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/) that allows you to create Twitch banners!

I spent some time to refresh the look of my banners, so here they are:

![when I am offline]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/assets/twitch-banner-offline.png)

When you are offline it could be useful to give information about the schedule

![when I am about to start]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/assets/twitch-banner-starting.png)

When I am ready to start, this is what you'll see approximately 5 or 10 minutes before I live.

![when I am taking a break]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/assets/twitch-banner-pause.png)

If, for some reasons, I have to take a break during the stream, this is what you'll get.

![when I am at the end]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/assets/twitch-banner-thankyou.png)

When I am at the end of the streaming session, I am used to fade out with this banner, thank you to all my viewers!

### A more meaningful donation goal

I thought about what could be a good streaming setup improvement, and I ended up by create a _single package_ that includes:

* A better camera
* An USB 3.0 hub with 4 ports
* A brand new keyboard

If you want to know more about the _donation goal_ read the *FAQ* panel of the [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/joebew42), and if you think you can contribute to support the channel, I will really appreciate your donation!

Thank you! See you on Monday <3
