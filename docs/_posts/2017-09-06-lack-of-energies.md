subtitle: Learning from the failures.

*TL;DR;* It was not a good day :(

**What I learned from this session**

* If you are out of energies, it will be very difficult to keep a positive mood.
* If you are out of energies but you committed for a schedule, you have to guarantee the schedule.
* Don't try to talk a lot if you have no enough energies, try to talk only if you think is really needed.
* If you had no new followers during the stream session, it can happen, just continue to push.

We will see at the next episode!
