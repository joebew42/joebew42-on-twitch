subtitle: A briefly summary about what I think I've learned from the experience of September
---

I would like to write a briefly summary about the first month experience of September :)

## What I learned from the past month

- _Schedule and consistency_ is absolutely important
- _Don't stare at the dashboard_. Keep the focus on what you are doing!
- _Don't bother about numbers_. Don't care about the number of viewers!
- _The interaction with the viewers is fulfilling_. It is just awesome to have a talk with other viewers!

## What are my plans for October

Here I will share what I think about the _growth_ of the channel

I would like to push for an _Organic growth_ of the channel. Instead of _spamming_ my channel all around the Internet, I prefer to look for the right niche, starting from the smaller one to end up with the bigger one. What I mean about _small_ is for example, local communities, subreddits, dedicated forums, etc. For _big_ I mean Twitter or official channels where I can advertise my channel. Sustain an _organic growth_ let me to validate and build a mature streaming format.

What about the _Minimum Marketable Features set_, a minimum set of things that can brings value to the market (here the market is you, the developer!).

This will be my minimum set of things is:

- Educational contents (best practices to apply when writing code)
- Schedule consistency
- Learning new stuff (programming languages or tools)
- Contribution to open source projects
