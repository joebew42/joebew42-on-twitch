We continued to learn Elixir with our exercises in order to get more confidence with [Processes](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir-playground/tree/master/examples/bank_account) by trying to write a simple program for manage bank accounts.

We [tried to extract](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir-playground/commit/6fc1b95c03ae006839257d4fb920e1d3d72009fe) the state from the `Bank`, as a new and isolated Process that we called `BankAccount`.

## Feedback about the session

* We peaked 13 viewers online! It was great :)
* We had some returning viewers, I liked it very much! Thank you!
* Sometimes I have to give some context about what we are doing.
* Maybe could be useful to share a sort of `roadmap` with the viewers. We can occupy the last 5 or 10 minutes of the session by talking about the topic of the next session, or asking what topic the viewers would like to view.
