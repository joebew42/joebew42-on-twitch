subtitle: Towards the last week of September ...

The next week will be the 4th week of scheduled live streaming of my channel. I'll write a journal at the end of September just to share with you what I learned and some considerations about my experience on Twitch.

I will be live on Monday 25th, Wednesday 27th and Friday 29th of September. If you want to know more about the time, take a look a the panel _Schedule_ that you'll find by visiting my Twitch channel.

Since the month of **September** was a _warm-up_ month that helped me to get enough confidence with Twitch and a little niche of people, by the first episode of **October** I will write something about my channel on the subreddit [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) just to let other people to know about the twitch channel, there I hope to find interested people in the project :) Hoping for the best!

## What [l]earned in this episode

* +1 follower :D
* I was a bit tired but I think it's something about rhythm and habit

For now I thanks all the viewers and we will see you on Monday 25th!
