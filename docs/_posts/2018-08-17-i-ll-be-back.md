# A little break from Twitch

It is time to make it official! As I said on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B7HS2AT) and during previous live coding sessions, I have to take a little break from Twitch until **November or December** (_I'm fine folks! I only need time to reorganize some personal and work stuff_).

## And now?

- If you are interested to search for other live coding sessions, I recommend you to take a look at the [**programming community on Twitch**](https://www.twitch.tv/communities/programming) or check this "Awesome" GitHub repository [**Awesome Developer Streams**](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams).
- I will be available on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/B7HS2AT), you can find me there if you need to contact me!
- Since I will be away from Twitch for a few months, we could use this time to organize ideas, proposals and feedback in order to improve the quality of the channel. Here, we can discuss about all these stuff on Discord, and even better on this [**issues page**](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch/issues). Feel free to join existing discussion or open new proposals!

## A past live coding session

Here below you can watch a recorded live coding session! During this session we were refactoring [our code](https://github.com/joebew42/ex_chat) trying to figure out how to introduce some concepts of [clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

That's all folks! Let's continue to keep in touch through Discord, GitHub or Twitter :)
