I am pretty satisfied about the episode of today. I had enough energies to do the stream. The statistics about the streaming was good too. We had a new follower! Thank you.

This time, in a way that was absolutely unexpected, we produced a content that is worth to be exported to YouTube. I have temporarily exported the video as _private_ and can be found  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InBzYTlyrL8). During the next days I will edit the video in order to make it public. The title will be _"How to keep a good pace when doing refactoring"_.

## Feedbacks

* I am getting more confidence with the audience and with my english, I know that it is not fluent but I hope to improve by continuing with the stream.
* Maybe in the future I will organize _pair programming_ sessions with my viewers too :)
* I tried the _contest_ feature of the bot I am [using](https://streamelements.com/). It was funny!
