## The Hacktoberfest 2017

As a lot of you already know, the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a recurring annual event, sponsorized by DigitalOcean and GitHub, which has the purpose to promote the contribution to open source projects.

I took the opportunity to partecipate to this event by doing it live on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/joebew42). I decided to split the day in two parts, the _morning_ and the _afternoon_. I started at the 10:00 AM an I tried to organize the morning session as follow:

- A time boxed activity (about 1 hour) with the goal to find some open source projects where contribute in
- 2 hours of programming session in order to try to fix some issues on the projects we found at the first step

The project I found was [ElixirStatus-Web](https://github.com/rrrene/elixirstatus-web) that is a micro-blogging platform about Elixir resources.

The morning session ended at 1:00 PM.

After the lunch, I started the afternoon session at 3:00 PM and I continued to do stream for other 3 hours.

During the 3 hours I continued to make some little changes in order to contibute to this project and the final result was three pull-request:

- [Autogenerate IDs for users](https://github.com/rrrene/elixirstatus-web/pull/60)
- [Update the documentation](https://github.com/rrrene/elixirstatus-web/pull/59)
- [How to run tests](https://github.com/rrrene/elixirstatus-web/pull/58)

At the end of the straming session the experience was really satisfying but at the same time really tiring:

## Why really satisfying?

- The viewers: It's always good to talk with the viewers, interact and learn with them. Some viewers helped me to better understand some points of the project! I love to have interactions with the viewers, thank you folks :)
- The project: I had the opportunity to take a project and learn a lot about the programming language (Elixir) itself and a framework (Phoenix framework)
- At the end I pushed three pull-requests! :)

## Why really tiring?

- Doing a full-day long streaming session trying to talk continuously in order to describe what I am doing or answer to viewers is very very very very challenging, at the end of the day I clearly remember that I had no voice :/
- Keep the focus is not easy cause after two or more hours the threshold attention go drastically down. I tried to use the pomodoro technique so that I had a 5 minutes break each 25 minutes of programming session.

## Final thoughts

In general what I can say is that this was an awesome experience. I thought more than once that - _maybe_ - a day I could go for a full-time streaming 5 days a week / 8 hours a day with the following content:

- Share the good practices of software development
- Improve the programming discipline
- Contribute to open source projects
- Learn a lot of new stuff (programing language, technologies and other)

Anyway I will continue to find a way to make it real!

Thank you all for watching me! See you on Twitch!
