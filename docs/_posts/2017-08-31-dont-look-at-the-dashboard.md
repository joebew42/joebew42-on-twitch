Today I made just 1 hour and 45 minutes of streaming. I did not feel satisfied at 100%, probably because I was a bit tired from the workday and I was not full of energy. I continued my path on [learning elixir](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir-playground) trying to do some code refactoring.

**What are my feelings about the session**

* I tend to look at the Twitch dashboard too often, this makes the stream not linear.
* Maybe I talk too much about a topic, I've try to be shorter.

**What's good**

* +1 Follower. Now the channel have 26 followers! Is always a good thing when someone put a follow on you :)
