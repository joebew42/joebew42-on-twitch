title: The warm up session before the 4th of September
subtitle: Why Elixir? And what I learned?
---

I just finished a *warm up session* of 2 hours, before tomorrow, when I will stream the first official session of my channel.

I continued my session about [learning Elixir](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir-playground) by following the practice of Test-Driven Development. I liked the Q&A session with my viewers, I really like to talk with others. One of the question I liked was **Why you decided to start learning Elixir?**, I give here my answer:

> It's fun and easy to learn! It compile byte-code that runs on Erlang virtual machine and basically it inherits all the qualities of Erlang. If you don't know Erlang, it is basically an awesome implementation of what OOP should be, in a functional fashion!

## What are my feedbacks about the session

* It's tiring but challenging and satisfying at the same time.
* The 2 hours format seems to works weel.
* I'm happy about new followers, now we are 30!

## What about tomorrow

I will try to follow the [**TODO list** of the BankAccount exercise](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir-playground/blob/master/examples/bank_account/scratch.md).

* each account may be a process

We are going to see how it is possible to extract a state as a process.

## What else

By now, I would like to thanks all my viewers!
