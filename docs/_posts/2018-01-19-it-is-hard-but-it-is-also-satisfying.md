subtitle: I wanted to share what is happening after four months of streaming experience on Twitch
---

Four months have passed since I decided to create a [twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/joebew42) with the idea in mind to build a nice community around topics like TDD, Clean Code and all those programming practices that can help us to become better software developers. It's not just theory, It's practical, because I tend to look for opensource projects where to hack in by applying those practices!

Today some very gratifying things happened, and this is the _why_ of this journal. First of all I would thank you [WeDoTDD](https://twitter.com/WeDoTDD) for supporting me in different ways:

_Woah! Thank you for the support and for the "TDD for life!"_ :)

... Of course, I also got a tweet!

I am very grateful to [Dave Schinkel](https://twitter.com/DaveSchinkel) for its support!

Going on during my streaming I read something even great in the chat:

![TDD for life! :)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/assets/gg1-scratchpad.png){: .center-image }

This, for me, it's really great because means that people find value in watching the channel. It is very satisfying reading that the practices I show can effectively improve the way other software developers are used to work! However I'll wait for other feedback as always :)

Speaking about feedback, some days ago I got a [first suggestion](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch/issues/19) about using [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) to enhance the interaction with the viewers! It is a very interesting idea and I think I'll give it a try in the future, maybe **to host a pair-programming session** or an **interview to someone who wants to share their experiences** about software development. If you are reading at this and you have a proposal for the channel, consider to send an issue to the [public feedback box](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch) or you can join to the existing ones!

## What next?

Since I streamed about [Elixir and GraphQL](https://github.com/joebew42/elixir_absinthe_playground) for one week or more, it's time to pause it for a moment and come back to contribute to some opensource projects, like the [changelog.com](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch/issues/14) platform maybe, I am waiting to receive a feature to work on. Probably I'll be hacking on it in the **next episode of Monday, 22th of January**. So, don't miss it if interested :)

## Thank you all viewers

As a new streamer in town, I learned that keeping schedule consistency can be hard and sometimes very tiring (even more if you do that as side activity), but from other hand it is also so very satisftying because it helps you to improve the way to be more disciplined, improve the mastery of programming practices, meet people from all around the world and especially when you see that what you do can be helpful for others.

I want to thank all the people who are keeping me company on this journey! Let's see what the next adveture will be!

See you on Twitch :)
