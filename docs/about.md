*Short story: I have started a [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/joebew42) about programming.*

This is the daily journal about my journey on Twitch. I will try to use this space to share my thoughts, considerations and updates about my streaming sessions with you, in order to collect feedback and improve the quality of the channel. So, If you want to know what I am doing on Twitch, you will find all information here.

Also, I will use this space to share useful resources about my experiences on Twitch: what I have found useful to improve my streaming, which tools I use, what are my goals, etc etc.

## Do you want to leave a feedback?

I use a [github repository as a public feedback box](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch), you can use it to propose your feedback about the Twitch Channel. To leave a feedback you can [open an issue](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch/issues) to:

- Propose a content that you would like to see in the next episodes
- Propose an open source project where to contribute in
- Propose an improvement of the schedule
- Propose something that can improve the quality of the channel

**Some requirements to consider before you propose a feedback:**

At the moment I am learning Elixir, so I prefer to continue by doing streaming session about Elixir programming language. If you want to propose a content or a project make sure to propose something about Elixir. Thank you!
