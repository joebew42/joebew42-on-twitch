*Short story: I have started a [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/joebew42) about programming.*

This is the daily journal about my journey on Twitch. I will try to use this space to share with you my thoughts, considerations and updates about my streaming sessions, in order to collect feedback and improve the quality of the channel. So, If you want to know what I am doing on Twitch, you will find all information here.

Also, I will use this space to share useful resources about my experiences on Twitch: what I have found useful to improve my streaming, which tools I use, what are my goals, etc etc.
