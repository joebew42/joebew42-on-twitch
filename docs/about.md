## Why a channel about Clean Coding?

About six years ago I started to work for an Agile Consulting company, and I was fortunate to meet an interesting workplace environment and awesome people that gave me the opportunity to learn and practice lot of the topics related to Agile Methodologies and Extreme Programming.

During this study and work period I understood how discipline and practices can be a very effective way to improve the way we work as computer programmer. Instead of rushing in trying to make the code to work as expected, we can apply some good practices and heuristics that can make the code more maintanable, with no need of rushing and in the other hand help us to maintain the development cycle healthy and sustainable regardless of the technologies and programming languages that we are used to work. In fact, changing my perspective on software development helped me to see technologies and programming languages as tools, that we may have choose based on the type of context we have to play in.

So, I decided to start this Twitch Channel with the idea to show these practices, share some useful resources, continue to learn by doing and of course trying to help other open source projects. I think it could be a good way to meet other people interested on these topics, and improve these skills, together!

## What this blog is about?

This is the daily journal about my journey on Twitch. I will try to use this space to share my thoughts, considerations and updates about my streaming sessions with you, in order to collect feedback and improve the quality of the channel. So, If you want to know what I am doing on Twitch, you will find all information here.

Also, I will use this space to share useful resources about my experiences on Twitch: what I have found useful to improve my streaming, which tools I use, what are my goals, etc etc.

## Do you want to leave a feedback?

I use a github repository as a [public feedback box](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch) so that you can use it to propose a feedback about the Twitch Channel. [Open an issue](https://github.com/joebew42/twitch/issues) to leave a feedback about:

- Propose a content that you would like to see in the next episodes
- Propose an open source project where to contribute in
- Propose an improvement of the schedule
- Propose something that can improve the quality of the channel

**Some requirements to consider before propose a feedback:**

At the moment I am learning Elixir, so I prefer to continue by doing streaming session about Elixir programming language. If you want to propose a content or a project make sure to propose something about Elixir. Thank you!
